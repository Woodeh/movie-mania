- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a component-based architecture that enables the development of reusable UI elements.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds type annotations to the language. It helps catch errors during development and improves code maintainability.
- **SCSS**: A CSS preprocessor that extends the capabilities of CSS. It allows for the use of variables, mixins, and other advanced features to enhance the styling process.
- **React Redux Toolkit**: A library that simplifies the usage of Redux, a state management tool for JavaScript applications. It provides utilities and abstractions to reduce boilerplate code and improve developer productivity.
