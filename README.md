The Movie-Mania App is built using the following technologies:

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a component-based architecture that enables the development of reusable UI elements.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds type annotations to the language. It helps catch errors during development and improves code maintainability.
- **SCSS**: A CSS preprocessor that extends the capabilities of CSS. It allows for the use of variables, mixins, and other advanced features to enhance the styling process.
- **React Redux Toolkit**: A library that simplifies the usage of Redux, a state management tool for JavaScript applications. It provides utilities and abstractions to reduce boilerplate code and improve developer productivity.
- **MUI (Material-UI)**: A popular React UI framework that provides a set of pre-built components following the Material Design guidelines. It offers a rich set of UI elements for creating a visually appealing and consistent user interface.
  
I also wanted to highlight the components and sites I used to create this app: 
1. **css glass** (glassmorphism-generator)
2. **background generator** by Superdesigner
3. **React Slick** component
